# Blender_Creations

Welcome to my **Blender Creations** repository! Here, I showcase some of my work and projects created using Blender. Below, you'll find various demonstrations of my skills:

---

## ðŸ”¹ **1. Character Creation**
The first image represents a character I created from scratch. This project helped me sharpen my modeling and design skills in Blender.

## ðŸ”¹ **2. Map Creation**
The second image is a map I created entirely from scratch with the help of AI. This map showcases my ability to design 3D environments and work with both Blender and AI tools.

## ðŸ”¹ **3. Animation**
The third image is a frame from an animation I generated myself. This demonstrates my ability to bring models to life through animation in Blender.
